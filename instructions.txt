This is a vanilla react project using the Material UI (MUI) style template

Start the project by running cd'ing into the project directory after it's been cloned locally.
Run this command and it will install all the dependencies, and reveal any errors:

npm install

I believe either the engine key:values were missing from the package.json file or the version for the node
node key was bad. In either case this is the correct engine config:

  "engines": {
    "node": "19.x",
    "npm": "9.x"
  }

the package.json file has a script for 'start' so use the following to serve locally:

npm start

If it's working locally it's time to deploy to heroku using the cli, while you're in the project directory
after you've pushed all your changes to remote 'git push origin main':

heroku create

Now that your project has a dyno and name on heroku, it's time to deploy:

git push heroku main

This app requires more memory so the build failed with the default dyno memory. Had to run the following to increase 
memory to 1024, and everything worked fine after that:

heroku config:set NODE_OPTIONS="--max_old_space_size=1024"
